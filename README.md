Sharpened Cosine Similarity enhanced with filtering for better feature extraction. Pytorch implementation.

## What is Sharpened Cosine Similarity and where did it come from?
[Brandon Rohrer](https://github.com/brohrer) shared his [insight on Twitter](https://twitter.com/_brohrer_/status/1232063619657093120?lang=en) about convolution layers not being a good feature extractors, and explained his idea to improve it (using cool animation!).
